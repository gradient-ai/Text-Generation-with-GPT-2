    "GPT-2 is a large transformer-based language model with 1.5 billion parameters, trained on a dataset[1]\n",
    "We created a new dataset which emphasizes diversity of content, by scraping content from the Internet. In order to preserve document quality, we used only pages which have been curated/filtered by humansâ€”specifically, we used outbound links from Reddit which received at least 3 karma. This can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting (whether educational or funny), leading to higher data quality than other similar datasets, such as CommonCrawl.\n",

    " of 8 million web pages. GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-2 displays a broad set of capabilities, including the ability to generate conditional synthetic text samples of unprecedented quality, where we prime the model with an input and have it generate a lengthy continuation. In addition, GPT-2 outperforms other language models trained on specific domains (like Wikipedia, news, or books) without needing to use these domain-specific training datasets. On language tasks like question answering, reading comprehension, summarization, and translation, GPT-2 begins to learn these tasks from the raw text, using no task-specific training data. While scores on these downstream tasks are far from state-of-the-art, they suggest that the tasks can benefit from unsupervised techniques, given sufficient (unlabeled) data and compute [https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/]\n",

You can't take anything apart. You can't be the center of the world, and then there's no way to make your world as useful as the center-piece of your world. We never have the power of the world. It's never the center of things, unless you have something more or less there. So I think we have to stop trying to make things as useful as our world, and to stop believing in our world. So, we need to start thinking about people who are actually making lives. So we need to start making people more powerful, kind of making people more useful. And that's just one way. But in my view of things and things that are useful, I think the way to do it is to take this whole thing apart into smaller pieces that are useful to me, because I just can't see the whole whole world as useless. I don't think that's the right way. I think you do have to take this piece off of your mind or your heart or your body and it's going to do nothing. That's just not going to work. People who have the ability to take the whole thing apart for a reason that makes it useful to them, for this reason, that makes them people, are going to have a problem. And so here, I think it's a real problem for ourselves, for the world, that I could never make it useful to me: Because I can't. Because I don't know how to do it. I'm not able to do it.

I think that's what I'd like it to be: Making things useful. And I think it is going to do that, and that's what's going to happen. That is what has happened and where is now.
